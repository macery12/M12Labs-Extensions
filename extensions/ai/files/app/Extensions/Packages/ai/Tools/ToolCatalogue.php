 * Deliberately dumb: no embeddings, no vector store, no database — a normalised
 * in-memory index over fifty-odd tools that changes only on deploy. At this size
 * the interesting failure is never recall but a *wrong* first result, and the
 * worst of those is an exact name losing to a near-miss: asking for
 * `startup_list` and getting `startup_set` changes what it meant to read.
 *
 * So ranking is tiered rather than blended — exact name beats exact alias beats
 * prefix beats every lexical score, and no accumulated token overlap climbs a
 * tier. Ties break on tool name, so the same query always returns the same order.
 *
 * Knows nothing about users, surfaces, sessions or permissions; it ranks the
 * candidates it is handed. Choosing *which* tools are candidates is
 * `ToolDiscoveryService`'s job, kept out so a search index cannot become a
 * second, weaker authorization path.
