/**
 * How one tool is *found*, as opposed to how it is run. Kept beside the
 * `ToolDefinition` it describes rather than in a parallel registry, which is the
 * obvious way to build this and the wrong one: the two drift, and the half that
 * drifts is the half nobody executes — so it surfaces as a tool that cannot be
 * searched for rather than as a failing test.
 *
 * None of this reaches the model as a schema. `ToolDefinition::toAiTool()` is
 * still the only thing that crosses into a prompt; this is what `ToolCatalogue`
 * searches, and a match yields a full schema only once the tool is in the
 * working set.
