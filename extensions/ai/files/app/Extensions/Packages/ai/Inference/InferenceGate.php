/**
 * Admission control for self-hosted inference: bounds concurrency against a
 * GPU's fixed capacity and queues the overflow.
 *
 * - Nobody waits in a worker. A turn with no slot gets a ticket and the request
 *   ends, so queueing costs no PHP worker.
 * - The ticket is the place in line. Presenting it again keeps the position;
 *   dropping it frees the place and the per-user reservation, with no reaper.
 * - Slots are locks, not queue entries. The queue decides who may try; taking
 *   the lock decides if one is free, so a crashed worker's slot returns on
 *   lock expiry.
 * - Resumes outrank new turns — they are half-finished and hold VRAM.
 * - The lease is turn-scoped: admitted once, held across every model call and
 *   tool execution rather than re-queued per step.
