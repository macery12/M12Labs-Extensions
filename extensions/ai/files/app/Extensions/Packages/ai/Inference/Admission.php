/**
 * The answer to "may this turn run now?".
 *
 * Two shapes, and the caller must handle both: it either holds a slot and can
 * start, or it holds a place in the queue and must come back. There is
 * deliberately no third shape where the caller waits — that was the old
 * behaviour, and waiting meant a PHP worker asleep on a poll loop for up to two
 * minutes while a GPU it could not use finished somebody else's turn. Under
 * contention the queue was consuming the very workers it existed to protect.
 *
 * A ticket is the queue place made portable. The client presents it on the next
 * attempt and keeps its position; presenting nothing joins at the back.
