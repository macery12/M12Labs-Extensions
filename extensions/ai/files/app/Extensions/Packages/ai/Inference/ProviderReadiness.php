/**
 * Is there anything on the other end of the configured AI provider?
 *
 * The panel already refused to start a turn for a provider that is misconfigured
 * or whose model cannot call tools, but neither of those questions is answered
 * against the network at the moment of asking: `capabilities()` is cached for
 * five minutes on Ollama, forever on a generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and
 * answered from a static table on Anthropic. So an endpoint that was working an
 * hour ago and has since been switched off still passed every gate. The turn was
 * admitted, the conversation opened, the message recorded, the job dispatched —
 * and then a worker sat on a socket that would never answer while the composer
 * span, the inference slot stayed held, and the next message queued behind it.
 *
 * This asks the one question those gates do not: is it answering *now*.
 *
 * Cheap enough to sit on the send path, by three separate mechanisms:
 *
 * - **A successful call is the probe.** Every inference request that comes back
 *   refreshes the marker, so an active conversation never probes at all — the
 *   turn that just worked is better evidence than a `/models` round trip.
 * - **A failed call is the probe too.** A transport error marks the provider
 *   unreachable immediately, so the send that follows an outage is refused from
 *   cache in microseconds rather than discovering the outage a second time.
 * - **Otherwise, at most one probe per window.** Only a first message after a
 *   quiet spell pays for one, and it pays with a short connect timeout rather
 *   than the generous read timeout a real turn needs.
 *
 * The unready window is deliberately shorter than the ready one. Being wrong
 * about "down" turns users away from a service that is back; being wrong about
 * "up" costs one turn that fails the slow way, which is what happened before
 * this existed.
