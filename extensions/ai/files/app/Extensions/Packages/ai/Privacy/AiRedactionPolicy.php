/**
 * When the AI module redacts, and which categories it sweeps.
 *
 * The engine itself is core's ({@see PackageRedaction}) because a core admin page
 * needs it too — see Everest\Services\Queue\FailedJobRedactor. What stayed
 * behind is everything that is genuinely a decision about *the AI module*: an
 * operator toggle, the category list they chose, and the rule that OpenRouter
 * always receives fully redacted context whatever they chose.
 *
 * Splitting it this way is what lets the two callers disagree. Redaction on its
 * way to an inference provider is an operator's call, because over-redacting
 * costs the model a fact it needed. Redaction on an admin page rendering a
 * failed job is not — there is no upside to showing the operator a customer's
 * address, so core sweeps unconditionally and never consults this class.
 *
 * Moves with the AI module when it becomes an extension.
