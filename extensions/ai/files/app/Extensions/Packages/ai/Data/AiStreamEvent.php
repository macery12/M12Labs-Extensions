 * A single event yielded by a streaming driver.

 * Drivers emit TEXT deltas as they arrive, TOOL_CALL_START as soon as a call's
 * name is known (so the UI can say "reading server.properties…" while the
 * arguments are still streaming in), and a fully assembled TOOL_CALL once its
 * argument JSON is complete.
 *
 * Reasoning arrives on its own channel rather than mixed into TEXT, because the
 * two are shown differently and only one of them is the answer. It comes in two
 * forms: REASONING carries human-readable deltas for display, REASONING_BLOCK
 * the provider's own opaque representation of a finished block, which some APIs
 * require echoed back verbatim on the next request.
