/**
 * Every AI configuration read, in one place.
 *
 * Before this, the module read its configuration from two stores directly and
 * in two spellings: `config('modules.ai.agent.max_steps')` and
 * `Setting::get('settings::modules:ai:agent:max_steps')`, with the second
 * overriding the first. Four classes had grown their own private `setting()`
 * helper doing the same string concatenation, and the precedence rule lived
 * nowhere except in the shape of about seventy call sites.
 *
 * The rule is: **an administrator's saved setting wins; the config file is the
 * default.** That is what `config/modules/ai.php` is for -- it supplies the
 * packaged default and the environment variable, and the settings table holds
 * what somebody typed into the admin pages.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as its own class
 *
 * The AI module is being extracted into an extension package, where neither
 * store is available: `config/modules/ai.php` is deleted with the module, and
 * `settings::modules:ai:*` is core's settings table, which a package may not
 * write to. Configuration moves to the package's declared settings, the
 * encrypted secret store, and one package-owned table for the structured
 * values a flat schema cannot express.
 *
 * Routing every read through here first means that swap is a change to this
 * file rather than to seventy call sites in twenty of them -- and, more to the
 * point, it is a change the module's existing tests can still prove, because
 * they are all present and passing on this side of the move.
 *
 * ## Keys
 *
 * One dotted key names a value in both stores: `agent.max_steps` reads
 * `settings::modules:ai:agent:max_steps` and falls back to
 * `config('modules.ai.agent.max_steps')`. Callers never spell either prefix.
 *
 * ## Three things about the two stores that are not obvious
 *
 * These were implicit in the old call sites and are written down here because
 * the extraction has to carry them across, and a fact that lives only in the
 * shape of seventy expressions does not survive being rewritten.
 *
 * 1. **`config()` is not just the file.** `SettingsServiceProvider::boot()`
 *    overlays every allowlisted setting onto config at boot, applying a
 *    string-to-type map on the way (`'true'` becomes `true`, `'1'` becomes
 *    `1`). So for an allowlisted key the two reads below usually agree, and
 *    the settings read is the one that has *not* been type-mapped. That is
 *    why the typed accessors here re-parse rather than cast: `(bool) 'false'`
 *    is `true`, and the raw settings value is where that string comes from.
 *
 * 2. **Secrets read back as a boolean through config.** For a key the secret
 *    encryption service recognises, boot deliberately sets
 *    `config($key, !empty($value))` rather than decrypting at boot. So
 *    `config('modules.ai.key')` is a presence flag and only the settings read
 *    returns the credential. A consequence worth knowing when this moves: an
 *    API key supplied by environment variable and never saved to the table
 *    resolves to the string `'1'`, because the fallback is that flag. The
 *    package's encrypted secret store has no such split and the problem goes
 *    away with it.
 *
 * 3. **Not every key is allowlisted.** The four structured blobs
 *    (`risk_overrides`, `disabled_tools`, `console.safe_commands`,
 *    `privacy.categories`), `agent.calibrated_tool_budgets`, and the
 *    `retention.*` and timeout values live in one store only. The lookup
 *    below is the same either way: an absent setting reads as null and the
 *    config value stands.
