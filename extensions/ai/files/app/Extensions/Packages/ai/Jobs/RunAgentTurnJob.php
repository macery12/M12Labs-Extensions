/**
 * Runs one agent turn outside the request that asked for it — the whole of
 * "durable execution". The request does what only a request can (admit against
 * the inference gate, reserve budget, open the conversation) and then ends;
 * what takes minutes, and what a closed tab used to kill, happens here.
 *
 * Three properties make that safe:
 *
 * - **One execution path.** The body is `HandlesAgentTurns::executeTurn()`, the
 *   same method the streaming controller calls; this job only changes where the
 *   events go. No second implementation to drift.
 * - **Authority is re-derived, not inherited.** `WorkerRequestScope` rebuilds
 *   the request context, and `TurnAuthority::stillHeld()` is re-asked at every
 *   step boundary, so signing out or suspending the account stops the turn.
 * - **It is never retried.** The queue cannot know which side effects landed
 *   before a worker died, so `$tries = 1` and `failed()` records the terminal
 *   state rather than repeating calls the user watched succeed.
