/**
 * Who a durable turn runs as, and for how long that stays true. A request-bound
 * turn ended with its request; once execution moves to a worker the two come
 * apart, and a turn that keeps its authority after the user logged out is a
 * credential with no owner.
 *
 * The identity is credential-equivalent: browser turns retain their originating
 * session, while API turns retain the key id and originating address. The secret
 * key itself never enters the queue payload; workers reload the database row and
 * therefore observe revocation, expiry, type/profile changes and IP restrictions.
 *
 * Validity is re-derived, never cached: `stillHeld()` is re-asked at every step
 * boundary, so logging out or suspending the account stops the turn at the next
 * safe point.
