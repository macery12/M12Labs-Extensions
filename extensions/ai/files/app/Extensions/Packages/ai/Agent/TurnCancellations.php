/**
 * Stopping a turn that is already running. Two properties pull in opposite
 * directions:
 *
 * 1. **A stop must survive the request that asked for it.** Asker and turn are
 *    different PHP processes, so the record is a column on the turn's usage row
 *    rather than a flag in memory.
 * 2. **A stop must never arrive mid-effect.** Tools are HTTP calls that cannot
 *    be un-started, so cancellation is only *observed* where nothing is
 *    half-done: between steps, before a dispatch, and between batch children. A
 *    tool in flight always finishes and reports.
 *
 * So a cancel is a request, not an instruction, and the columns say so:
 * `cancel_requested_at` is when the user asked, the `cancelled` status is when
 * the turn actually stopped.
 *
 * Reads are throttled rather than memoised, since the point is to observe a
 * write from a *different* process; only the positive is cached, as
 * cancellation does not un-happen.
