/**
 * The durable tail of a running turn. A turn that outlives its request has no
 * reader to write to, so it writes here and readers catch up from a cursor —
 * the stream becomes a *view* of the output, and losing a view costs nothing.
 *
 * Two rules govern what gets written:
 *
 * - **Sequence is allocated by the writer, not the database.** One turn has one
 *   writer, so an in-process counter seeded from storage is correct and costs no
 *   round trip per frame. The unique index is a safety net: a second worker on
 *   the same turn collides immediately rather than producing a plausible
 *   interleaved log.
 * - **A replayed frame may not carry more than a reloaded transcript would.**
 *   The shaped tool payload is live-only, so persisting it here would create the
 *   larger second copy that redaction and shaping exist to bound. `strip()`
 *   enforces it.
