/**
 * Gives a queue worker the one thing `ToolExecutor` cannot do without: a parent
 * request to derive sub-requests from. `buildSubRequest()` takes the scheme,
 * host and client address from it and copies its user resolver, none of which
 * exists in a worker.
 *
 * Safety comes from what it does *not* invent. No session, so
 * `UpdateUserSessionActivity` skips itself and a background turn can neither
 * create nor destroy one. No cookies, so nothing is decrypted or re-encrypted.
 * The identity carries the same credential kind as the starting request: a
 * `TransientToken` for a browser session, or the freshly-reloaded `ApiKey` for a
 * token request. That keeps key type/profile/IP middleware and activity
 * attribution authoritative inside every internal sub-request.
 *
 * The guard is primed rather than resolved: a `RequestGuard` returns the user
 * it was given without consulting the request. Skipped priming would 401, so
 * the failure direction is closed.
