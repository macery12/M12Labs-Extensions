 * What has to happen before a tool can run, and which tool makes it happen.

 * Exists for the chain models cannot infer: reading a customer's startup command
 * needs a resolved server, then an approved read-only session, then
 * `startup_list`. Without it the model does not make a wrong call — it announces
 * that the panel cannot read startup commands.
 *
 * **The cross-surface rule is derived, not declared.** A server-scoped tool on
 * an admin turn always needs an assist session, and `AssistToolSets::WRITE`
 * decides whether it must be writable. That is a fact about the two surfaces,
 * and writing it onto fifty-odd definitions is how one missed rename would make
 * a write reachable from a read-only session. `ToolDiscovery::$prerequisites`
 * covers the genuine exceptions, currently one.
 *
 * Nothing here grants anything: it returns gateway tool *names*, and those
 * gateways still suspend for approval, re-check `SERVERS_ASSIST` and write the
 * customer-visible activity row.
