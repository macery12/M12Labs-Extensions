/**
 * How many complete tool schemas this model can choose between in one step.
 *
 * A context window says how much a model can *hold*, not how many similar
 * options it can *discriminate between* — a 3B model with a 128K window still
 * calls the first tool whose schema parses when handed twenty. So the budget
 * comes from exact parameter metadata first, then a recognizable model name,
 * with provider-family and quantized-byte fallbacks. The profile table is a
 * starting point to be measured rather than a capability claim.
 *
 * `agent:max_tools` overrides it. Left unset it means "work it out," the useful
 * default: an operator installing a panel does not know their model's ceiling.
