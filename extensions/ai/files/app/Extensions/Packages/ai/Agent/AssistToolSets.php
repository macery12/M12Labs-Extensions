 * What the assistant is *offered* while a delegated session is open.
 *
 * The authority itself belongs to core — see
 * {@see \Everest\Services\Access\DelegatedGrant}. This is the other half of what
 * used to be one class: the tool names are named explicitly rather than derived
 * from the ability list, because the two are different kinds of statement. The
 * ability list is the boundary; this is only what gets advertised. A tool
 * offered without its ability is refused at dispatch, which is the correct way
 * round, and is why these can be maintained separately without becoming a hole.
 *
 * Moves with the AI module when it becomes an extension; the grant does not.
