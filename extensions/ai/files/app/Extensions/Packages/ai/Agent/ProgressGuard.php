 * Stops a turn that is going round in circles.

 * Step and wall-clock limits bound a turn badly for this failure: a model
 * repeating one call twelve times burns the budget and reports a timeout, which
 * tells the operator to raise a limit that was never the problem. Retrieval
 * makes it likelier — a model that cannot find a tool searches again in almost
 * the same words, and an unsatisfiable prerequisite is a wall it walks into
 * repeatedly.
 *
 * **What counts as identical:** the tool, its arguments, the outcome, a digest
 * of the result, and the turn's state version. That last term keeps legitimate
 * repetition working — polling through a restart returns different bytes, and a
 * call after an approval or phase change is a different call. Pagination differs
 * by arguments alone.
