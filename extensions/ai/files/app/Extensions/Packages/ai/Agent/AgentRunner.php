    | fifteen, and the card is the only thing standing between the model and the
    | panel. Reviewing less was never an option; reviewing the whole set at once,
    | before any of it runs, is.
    |
    | It also happens to be the only way the work fits at all. A suspension
    | carries `step` through `toState()`, so twenty sequential writes exhaust
    | `max_steps` long before they are done, and the one strategy that would fit
    | — twenty calls in a single response — is exactly what an approval destroys,
    | since the loop returns on the first suspension and `closeUnresolvedCalls()`
    | answers every sibling with `not_executed`.
