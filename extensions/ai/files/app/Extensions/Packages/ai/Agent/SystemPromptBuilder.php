/**

 *
 * The two surfaces get separate sections rather than one prompt with caveats: a
 * rule a model cannot act on still costs tokens every step and still gets tried.
 *
 * The behavioural section asks for sparse progress narration and forbids ending
 * a turn on an intention. Both are needed — "act, don't narrate" alone stopped
 * the wasted announcement step but also stripped every word explaining why a

              symptom is described and usually the only place the server is named. Then resolve the
