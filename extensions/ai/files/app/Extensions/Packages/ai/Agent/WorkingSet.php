/**
 * The tools offered for one step, and the phase that shaped them.
 *
 * A phase replaces what cumulative groups tried to be. Groups only ever grew: a
 * turn that looked at billing and then opened a session on a customer's server
 * was still carrying `admin_products_list`, because nothing ever put a group
 * back. A phase states what the conversation is *for* right now, so entering an
 * assist session drops the panel-browsing tools rather than accumulating on top
 * of them — which is both cheaper and more honest, since panel-wide browsing is
 * not part of diagnosing one server.
 *
 * Reserved sets are still permission-filtered by the planner. Being reserved
 * decides what is worth spending budget on; it decides nothing about authority.
