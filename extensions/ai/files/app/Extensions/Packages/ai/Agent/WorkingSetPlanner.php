/**
 * Decides which tools the model sees this step. Two rules do the work:
 *
 * - **Priority, not order.** Built from the top: discovery and safety exits, the
 *   phase's reserved reads, what the turn has pinned, the gateways those pins
 *   need, then whatever a search turned up. The old cap sliced a tail off a
 *   statically-ordered list, so what got dropped depended on where a tool
 *   happened to be written down.
 * - **Refuse rather than truncate.** A set that cannot hold what a turn requires
 *   is a planning failure naming the missing tools, not a shorter set — to a
 *   model, a missing tool and a nonexistent one are the same observation.
 *
 * Nothing here decides authority: candidates have already passed
 * `ToolRegistry`'s permission filter, pins are re-filtered every step, and being
 * reserved buys only a place in the queue.
