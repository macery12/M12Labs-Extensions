/**
 * What this conversation has actually done, counted from the transcript.
 *
 * Derived rather than reported, deliberately. The stream carries no per-session
 * totals today, and a column that quietly showed zeroes because the backend had
 * not been asked would be worse than one that showed nothing — so these are
 * counted from the entries already on screen, which means they are true by
 * construction and degrade to real numbers rather than to placeholders.
 *
 * `reads` counts every settled tool call, `changes` counts only the ones the
 * backend classified as writing something. A call that is still running is in
 * neither: it has not read or changed anything yet.
