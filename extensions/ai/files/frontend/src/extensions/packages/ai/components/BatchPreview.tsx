// The calls a batch will make, before any of them run.
//
// This is the whole feature as far as the user is concerned. A batch exists so
// that twenty product creations are one decision rather than twenty, and that
// only holds if the one decision is actually informed — otherwise it is
// auto-approval with a click attached.
//
// The rule used to be "nothing is hidden, only folded", which was not enough:
// calls seven onward were folded away and every call's arguments were folded
// shut, while the approve button stayed live the whole time. One click could
// therefore commit an unreviewed tail, and the only thing standing in for the
// evidence was a summary the model wrote about its own work.
//
// So folding is now separated from reviewing. Every call above SAFE has to be
// opened — its exact arguments put on screen — before the set can be approved,
// and the card says how many are outstanding. Reads still fold quietly: they
// change nothing, and demanding ceremony for them would train people to click
// through the ones that matter.
//
// The collapsed row carries the verb and the tool's primary argument, which for
// a product is its name. That pairing is what makes a list of twenty scannable —
// "Create product / Budget 4GB" answers what you need without opening anything,
// and the rows that look wrong are the ones you open.

 * How many rows are shown before the rest are folded away.

 * Enough that the common case — a handful of related changes — is fully visible
 * without interaction, and few enough that twenty of them do not push the
 * approve button off the screen. A card whose buttons cannot be seen is a card
 * that gets approved by scrolling.
