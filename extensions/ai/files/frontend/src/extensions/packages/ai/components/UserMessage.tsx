// It used to be the first line of the turn, at the heaviest weight on screen,
// flush left with everything else indented beneath it — which is the shape of a
// section heading in every document anyone has ever read, and so that is what it
// looked like. Four signals were saying "title" at once: heading position,
// heaviest weight, no attribution, no edges.
//
// Alignment fixes three of them at a stroke, and it is the one speech signal
// that costs no width — which is why it still works on a phone, where a tinted
// left-aligned block fills the column and stops reading as a message at all.
// It also makes the assistant's reply free: everything on the left is the
// assistant, by position, so the answer needs no avatar and no name.
//
// The fill is deliberately not `--color-surface-2`. That is what the old bubble
// used, and it was the same fill as a tool row — the two least similar things in
// the transcript wearing one colour. A faint shift toward brand keeps it unique
// to user messages in every theme, without spending the accent itself: colour
// here is rationed to the pending approval, which is the only thing that is
// actionable.
