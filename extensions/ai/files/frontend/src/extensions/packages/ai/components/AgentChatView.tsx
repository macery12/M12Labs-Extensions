// The conversation itself — transcript, composer, and the cards a turn can
// produce.

// Presentational and store-agnostic: both the server assistant and the admin
// assistant render this, so the entry-rendering switch and the suspension cards
// have exactly one implementation. Everything that differs between the two —
// which store, what the empty state says, what a destructive confirmation is
// typed against, which detail fields are worth showing — arrives as props.
//
// The transcript is grouped into turns rather than rendered as a flat list. A
// flat list is what made a question, the eight tool calls it caused, and the
// answer that followed all weigh the same and blur together: scroll back three
// turns and there was nothing on screen to say which work belonged to which
// question. A turn is opened by a user message and closed by the next one, which
// is the only boundary that has ever been true here.
//
// It used to carry a banner above the composer for an approval left unanswered
// on a previous visit, rebuilt from a poll of the pending endpoint. It is gone:
// an approval that is still on screen already has its card, and one that is not
// belongs to a turn nobody came back to — so the banner spent its life
// announcing a decision that had already been abandoned. `ask_user` made that
// plain, since a question is not an approval and the banner said it was.
// Anything genuinely unresolved expires on its own within the half hour.
