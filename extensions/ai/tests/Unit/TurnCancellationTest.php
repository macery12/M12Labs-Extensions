/**
 * Stopping a turn (DESIGN-003).
 *
 * Until now Stop aborted the browser's `fetch` and nothing else: the turn went
 * on thinking, went on spending budget, and went on running tools against a
 * reader who had asked it to stop. The button told the truth about what it did
 * — "stopped watching" — which is not what anybody pressing it means.
 *
 * Two properties, and they are in tension, so most of this file is about where
 * the line between them falls:
 *
 * 1. A stop must **reach the turn**, across a process boundary, durably.
 * 2. A stop must **never land mid-effect**. Tools are HTTP calls through the
 *    panel's own middleware, several against a remote node; none of them can be
 *    un-started. So cancellation is observed only where nothing is half-done.
