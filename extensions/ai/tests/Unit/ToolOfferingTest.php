/**
 * What the model is actually handed.
 *
 * This file used to be about a cap that truncated a tail. The tail was
 * `activate_tool_group`, so a fully-permissioned server turn dropped the one
 * tool that could reach any of the others and every grouped tool became
 * unreachable — while the base set, partitioned by feature area rather than by
 * what a tool does, kept the writes and gated the cheap reads. The result was an
 * agent that could delete a directory without ceremony but could not say which
 * port the server listened on.
 *
 * Nothing truncates now. `WorkingSetPlanner` builds a set in priority order and
 * refuses a change it cannot make whole, so the tests here are about that
 * refusal and about the priority — the two properties the old design lacked.
