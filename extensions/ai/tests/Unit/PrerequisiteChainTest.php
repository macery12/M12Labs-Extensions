/**
 * The chain a model cannot infer.
 *
 * An administrator asked to read a customer's startup command needs a resolved
 * server, then an approved read-only session, and only then the tool they
 * actually wanted. Every step of that is obvious afterwards and invisible in
 * advance, and the failure without it is not a wrong call — it is a confident
 * report that the panel cannot read startup commands.
 *
 * The other half of what these check is that making a tool *discoverable* never
 * makes it *usable*. A declaration says what to do next; `DelegatedAccess` and
 * the approval card decide whether it happens.
