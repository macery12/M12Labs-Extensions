/**
 * Admission control for self-hosted inference. The cache store under test is
 * the array driver, which supports the same atomic lock and counter primitives
 * the Redis store uses in production.
 *
 * The property most of this file exists to pin is that **nothing waits**. The
 * gate used to block in a sleep loop, which meant a queued turn held a PHP
 * worker for as long as it was queued — so the queue consumed the capacity it
 * was there to protect, and its depth had to be clamped against the deployment's
 * worker pool to stop it taking the panel down. A turn that cannot have a slot
 * now leaves with a ticket, and comes back for it.
